Source code for the Alexa Skill now known as [The Arlen Bystander](https://www.amazon.com/Lane-Kelly-The-Arlen-Bystander/dp/B01HCNS4FU). 

Originally called Boomhauer, I had to change it to a non-anthropromorphic title to pass Amazon's submission process.

The project was inspired by Amazon's offer of a free t-shirt (which I never received ðŸ˜ž) as well as numerous nights of trolling the Wikipedia waters for an episode of King of the Hill to watch.
